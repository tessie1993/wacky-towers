## Phase 1: Detect Project State

Emit one line before reading: `"Scanning project artifacts..."` — this confirms the
skill is running during the silent read phase.

Then read silently before presenting anything else.

### Existence check
- `project.stage` in `project.yaml` (fallback `production/stage.txt`) — if either is present, use that value (authoritative phase)
- `design/gdd/game-concept.md` (or, at the minimal tier, `design/game-brief.md`) — concept exists?
- `design/gdd/systems-index.md` — systems index exists?
- Count GDD files: `design/gdd/*.md` (excluding game-concept.md and systems-index.md)
- Count ADR files: `docs/architecture/adr-*.md`
- Count story files: `production/epics/**/*.md` (excluding EPIC.md)
- `project.yaml` (`engine.name`) / `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` — engine configured?
- `docs/engine-reference/` — engine reference docs present?
- Glob `docs/adoption-plan-*.md` — note the filename of the most recent prior plan if any exist

### Infer phase (if no project.stage / stage.txt)
Use the same heuristic as `/project-stage-detect`:
- 10+ source files in the code root → Production
- Stories in `production/epics/` → Pre-Production
- ADRs exist → Technical Setup
- systems-index.md exists → Systems Design
- game-concept.md (or `design/game-brief.md`) exists → Concept
- Nothing → Fresh (not a brownfield project — suggest `/start`)

If the project appears fresh (no artifacts at all), use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "This looks like a fresh project — no existing artifacts found. `/adopt` is for
  projects with work to migrate. What would you like to do?"
  - "Run `/start` — begin guided first-time onboarding"
  - "My artifacts are in a non-standard location — help me find them"
  - "Cancel"

Then stop — do not proceed with the audit regardless of which option the user picks
(each option leads to a different skill or manual investigation).

Report: "Detected phase: [phase]. Found: [N] GDDs, [M] ADRs, [P] stories."
