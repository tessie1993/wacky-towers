# /ux-design — Sections 5 and 6: Cross-Reference Check and Handoff

> Part of `/ux-design`. `SKILL.md` names when to read this file; the settings it

## 5. Cross-Reference Check

Before marking the spec as ready for review, run these checks:

**1. GDD requirement coverage**: Does every GDD UI Requirement that references
this screen have a corresponding element in this spec? Present any gaps.

**2. Pattern library alignment**: Are all interaction patterns used in this spec
referenced by name? If a new pattern was invented during this spec session, flag
it for addition to the pattern library:
Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "This spec uses [pattern name], which isn't in the pattern library yet. What should we do?"
- Options: "Add it to the pattern library now", "Flag it as a gap and continue", "Skip — this pattern is one-off"

**3. Navigation consistency**: Do the entry/exit points in this spec match the
navigation map in any related specs? Flag mismatches.

**4. Accessibility coverage**: Does the spec address the accessibility tier
committed to in `design/accessibility-requirements.md`? If not, flag open questions.

**5. Empty states**: Does every data-dependent element have an empty state defined?
Flag any that don't.

Present the check results:
> **Cross-Reference Check: [Screen Name]**
> - GDD requirements: [N of M covered / all covered]
> - New patterns to add to library: [list or "none"]
> - Navigation mismatches: [list or "none"]
> - Accessibility gaps: [list or "none"]
> - Missing empty states: [list or "none"]

## 6. Handoff

When all sections are approved and written:

### 6a: Update Session State

Update `production/session-state/active.md` with:
- Task: [screen-name] UX spec
- Status: Complete (or In Review)
- File: design/ux/[filename].md
- Sections: All written
- Next: [suggestion]

### 6b: Suggest Next Step

Before presenting options, state clearly:

> "This spec should be validated with `/ux-review` before it enters the
> implementation pipeline. The Production gate (`/gate-check production`)
> requires all key screen specs to have passed `/ux-review` at `workflow: full`
> (recommended at `standard`)."

Then use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "Run `/ux-review [filename]` now, or do something else first?"
  - Options:
    - "Run `/ux-review` now — validate this spec"
    - "Design another screen first, then review all specs together"
    - "Update the interaction pattern library with new patterns from this spec"
    - "Stop here for this session"

If the user picks "Design another screen first", add a note: "Reminder: run
`/ux-review` on all completed specs before running `/gate-check production`."

### 6c: Cross-Link Related Specs

If other UX specs link to or from this screen, note which ones should reference
this spec. Do not edit those files without asking — just name them.
